Final Project Questions for MATH 499 - Linear Algebra for Data Science

We were assigned 6 problems throughout the course where we were asked to analyze several datasets and apply knowledge we learned during the course. The topics for each of the questions are listed below, but you can find the project questions [here](https://github.com/owencqueen/DataScience_Final_Project/blob/main/project_questions.pdf).

## Questions:

1. Singular value decomposition (SVD) on images 
2. Principal component analysis (PCA) on cancer genomics data
3. Lasso regression on housing data
4. k-means clustering on retail customer data
5. Gradient descent optimization (including RMSProp)
6. Convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the presence of masks in headshots (images)
